= AsciiDoc.NET Library

AsciiDoc.NET is a native .NET library designed to parse AsciiDoc documents and convert them into structured models and various output formats. It provides a modern, implementation of the AsciiDoc specification for all .NET Standard 2.0+ platforms.



== Overview

AsciiDoc.NET delivers a comprehensive, extensible, and high-performance AsciiDoc processor for the .NET ecosystem. Its objectives are:

* Parse AsciiDoc files into a structured, object-oriented document model based on the official AsciiDoc specification.
* Provide modular, pluggable output converters (HTML, Markdown, etc.), with HTML as the primary focus.
* Ensure broad compatibility by targeting .NET Standard 2.0 (usable from .NET Framework 4.6.1+, .NET Core 2.0+, .NET 5+, and later).
* Offer a solid architectural foundation that is easy to extend and maintain.
* Deliver production-quality code with comprehensive documentation and automated testing.
